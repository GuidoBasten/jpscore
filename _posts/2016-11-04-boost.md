One of  `JuPedSim`'s [requirements](2016-11-03-requirements.html) is Boost. 

In order to make sure that this library is properly installed,  this *minimal working* example can be very handy.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "boost/filesystem.hpp"
using namespace boost::filesystem;

int main()
{
     
  boost::filesystem::path pProgram( boost::filesystem::current_path() );
  std::string workingDirectory = pProgram.parent_path().string();
  
  std::cout << "Using Boost version: "
            << BOOST_VERSION / 100000     << "."  // major version
            << BOOST_VERSION / 100 % 1000 << "."  // minor version
            << BOOST_VERSION % 100                // patch level
            << std::endl;

  std::cout << "Working directory: "<< workingDirectory << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Using the following [CMakeLists.txt](https://gitlab.version.fz-juelich.de/jupedsim/jpscore/snippets/8) 
the compilation of the aforementioned file goes like

```bash
cmake .
```

or 

```bash
cmake -DBoost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS=true -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost .
```

if you did not install Boost in a system path.

It is also possible to compile the code directly without passing by `CMake`, however since it is used with `JuPedSim`, it is a 
good idea to test it here too.
