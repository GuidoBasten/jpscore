Diff commits are much more clearer and cleaner.\n\n\nThe code is formated using the automatic formatter \nastyle\n  with the option \n--style=stroustrup\n:\n\n\n\n\nStroustrup style formatting/indenting uses stroustrup brackets.\nBrackets are broken from function definitions only.\nBrackets are attached to everything else including\nnamespaces, classes, and statements within a function, arrays, structs, and enums.\nThis style frequently is used with an indent of 5 spaces.\n\n\n\n\nHere is an \nexample:\n\n\nint Foo(bool isBar)\n{\n     if (isBar) {\n          bar();\n          return 1;\n     } else\n          return 0;\n}\n\n\n\n\nTabs vs Spaces\n\n\nThis can be a long and religious discussion, to make it short \nDO NOT\n use tabs, just spaces.\n\n\nHere are some hints to configure your editor in order to use the \nstroustrup\n style\n\n\n\n\nEmacs\n:\n    Add this to your \n.emacs\n\n\n\n\n(setq c-default-style \nstroustrup\n c-basic-offset 5)\n(setq indent-tabs-mode nil)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVim\n:\n    Set in your config file these variables\n\n\n\n\n:set autoindent\n:set cindent\n:set expandtab\n:set shiftwidth=5\n:set softtabstop=5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEclipse\n:\n    Here is a \nplugin\n for astyle in eclipse.\n    Read also\n    \nHow to change indentation width in eclipse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClion\n: preferences -\n Editor -\n Code Style \n C++ \n predefined style \n Stroustrup.  See also following screen-shot. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit tests\n\n\nTesting should be enabled by cmake as follows:\n\n\ncmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON ..\n\n\n\n\nAfter compiling (\nmake\n) the tests can be called as follows:\n\n\nctest\n\n\n\n\nThis will take some hours time (depending on your machine). Threfore, a quick testing could be used:\n\n\nctest -R Boost\n\n\n\n\nwhich run a limited set of compiled unit tests on the code.\n\n\nWriting a unit test\n\n\nIf you write a unit test the first lines in your file should be\n\n\n#define BOOST_TEST_MODULE MyTest\n#define BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK\n#include \nboost/test/unit_test.hpp\n\n#include classtotest.h\n\nBOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE(MyTestClass)\n\n\n\n\nThen you can start implementing your test cases by using\n\n\nBOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(MyTestCase) \n{\n  ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor each method or function you want to test you should write a new test case and give it a speaking name.\n\n\nVerification and validation\n\n\nBesides unit testing, we use in JuPedSim python-driven tests for verification and validation purposes.\nSeveral validation and verification tests for \nJuPedSim\n (jpscore) are defined in the following section (e.g. Rimea and NIST).\nIn order to make the nightly builds run automatically, consider the following steps, before adding new tests.\nThis procedure is also recommended to make simulations with several inifiles e.g. different seeds.\n\n\nTo write additional tests, create a directory under \nUtest/\n.\n\n\n\n\nCreate in \n./jpscore/Utest/\n a new direct with a descriptive name. For\n   example: \n/Utest/test_case1/\n\n\nPut in that directory an ini-file (referred to as \nmaster-inifile\n)\n   and all the relevant files for a simulation, e.g. geometry file, etc. In the master-inifile you can use python syntax\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n   \nmax_sim_time\n[3,4]\n/max_sim_time\n \n   \nseed\nrange(1, 10)\n/seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrun the script \nmakeini.py\n with the obligatory option \n-f\n: Using the\n    aforementioned example the call is:\n\n\n\n\n   python makeini.py -f test_case1/inifile.xml\n\n\n\n\nThe Script is going to create two directories:\n- test_case/trajectories: Here live the simulation trajectories.\n- test_case/inifiles: and here the inifiles, that will be produced  based on the master inifile (in this case test_case1/inifile.xml).\n    Note, that the geometry file and the trajectory files are all relative to the project files in the directory \ninifiles\n.\n\n\n\n\nWrite a runtest-script. Here you have to define the logic of your test. What should be tested? When does the file succeed or file? etc.\n\n\n\n\nYour script has to start with the following lines:\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom sys import *\nsys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(sys.path[0])))\nfrom JPSRunTest import JPSRunTestDriver\nfrom utils import *\n\n\n\n\nAfter including these lines you can write the test you want to perform for every ini-file generated from the makeini.py script.\nThe method signature must contain at least two arguments to receive the inifile and the trajectory file from the simulation.\n\n\ndef runtest(inifile, trajfile):\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use more than these arguments like this:\n\n\ndef runtest(inifile, trajfile, x, y, z):\n\n\n\n\nIf you need a more complex example of how to use more arguments for further calculations please see runtest_14.py.\nIf a test has to fail because an error occurs or a necessary condition is not fulfilled  you can simply exit the script by using something like\n\n\nif condition_fails: \n  exit(FAILURE)\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have written your test you have to make your script executable, so it has to contain a main function which calls the test:\n\n\nif __name__ == \n__main__\n:\n  test = JPSRunTestDriver(1, argv0=argv[0], testdir=sys.path[0])\n  test.run_test(testfunction=runtest)\n  logging.info(\n%s exits with SUCCESS\n % (argv[0]))\n  exit(SUCCESS)\n\n\n\n\nWriting Documentation\n\n\nComments\n\n\nComments have to be written in \nEnglish\n everywhere. Please use markdown where applicable.\n\n\nDocumenting new features\n\n\nPlease update the changelog with every feature/fix you provide so we can keep track of changes for new versions of JuPedSim.\n\n\nSample Templates\n\n\n/*!\n * \\file [filename]\n *\n * \\author [your name]\n * \\date\n * \\version     v[x.y]\n * \\copyright   \n2016-2022\n Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH.

To write additional tests, create a directory under  Utest/ .   Create in  ./jpscore/Utest/  a new direct with a descriptive name. For\n   example:  /Utest/test_case1/  Put in that directory an ini-file (referred to as  master-inifile )\n   and all the relevant files for a simulation, e.g. geometry file, etc. In the master-inifile you can use python syntax   Example:      max_sim_time [3,4] /max_sim_time  \n    seed range(1, 10) /seed    run the script  makeini.py  with the obligatory option  -f : Using the\n    aforementioned example the call is:      python makeini.py -f test_case1/inifile.xml  The Script is going to create two directories:\n- test_case/trajectories: Here live the simulation trajectories.\n- test_case/inifiles: and here the inifiles, that will be produced  based on the master inifile (in this case test_case1/inifile.xml).\n    Note, that the geometry file and the trajectory files are all relative to the project files in the directory  inifiles .   Write a runtest-script. Here you have to define the logic of your test. What should be tested? When does the file succeed or file? etc.   Your script has to start with the following lines:  #!/usr/bin/env python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom sys import *\nsys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(sys.path[0])))\nfrom JPSRunTest import JPSRunTestDriver\nfrom utils import *  After including these lines you can write the test you want to perform for every ini-file generated from the makeini.py script.\nThe method signature must contain at least two arguments to receive the inifile and the trajectory file from the simulation.  def runtest(inifile, trajfile):  You can also use more than these arguments like this:  def runtest(inifile, trajfile, x, y, z):  If you need a more complex example of how to use more arguments for further calculations please see runtest_14.py.\nIf a test has to fail because an error occurs or a necessary condition is not fulfilled  you can simply exit the script by using something like  if condition_fails: \n  exit(FAILURE)  Once you have written your test you have to make your script executable, so it has to contain a main function which calls the test:  if __name__ ==  __main__ :\n  test = JPSRunTestDriver(1, argv0=argv[0], testdir=sys.path[0])\n  test.run_test(testfunction=runtest)\n  logging.info( %s exits with SUCCESS  % (argv[0]))\n  exit(SUCCESS)",
