# Workflow

This is a git-specific workflow that helps you contribute flawlessly you JuPedSim.

- Clone the project (for the first time)

```
    git clone https://cst.version.fz-juelich.de/jupedsim/jpscore.git
```

- Change to the developement branch and create a branch with your feature.

```
    git checkout developement 
    git checkout -b feature_name
```

- Write code and Commit changes

```
    git commit -m "Describe here your changes"
```

- Push your branch to GitLab. But before doing so, [test](pushing) your code.

```
    git push origin feature_name
```
    
- Create a merge request

    a *Master* will review your code & merge it to the developement branch (maybe).
